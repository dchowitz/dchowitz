- 👋  Hi, I’m Denny Christochowitz.
- 👀  I’m interested in programming computers (in a vast sense).
- 🌱  I’m currently learning ... LISP because I stumbled upon [this](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) and got curious.
- :pencil: Sometimes I find some time to spread [some words](https://dev.to/dchowitz). 
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on a Prettier-like opinionated formatter for C# in VS Code.
- 📫  Reach out: [@dchowitz](https://twitter.com/dchowitz), denny(dot)christochowitz(at)gmail(dot)com
